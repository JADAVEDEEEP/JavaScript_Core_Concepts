//ARRAY EXECUTE DIFFRENT WAY
//we can also store diffrent values like string,numbervalues on array
const deep = new Array(1991,1992,1999)//we use over here the array function becuse we called over here using parenthesis with new kewyword

console.log(friends.length)//to specfiy the lengh of ann array

//michel will be sotred becuse they will start with 0 michel has 0 value
//isndie this bracckets we can put any thing like number string
